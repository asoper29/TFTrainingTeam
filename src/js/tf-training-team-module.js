Exercise and food struggles are something many of us deal with, but what set her apart in this transformation is the way she approached her future change. After the birth of our daughter, Marissa chose action over excuse. It was at this point where all passive behavior was cast out. Tough, intense workouts and consistent, smart eating were the foundations of her change. While she's not where she wants to be just yet, she continues to push forward and become more educated in her fitness journey."

Our workouts are fun and challenging, but more importantly, the teamwork of the TF Training Team Fitness Family is what kept him coming back. Down 52 lbs and 6 inches in his waist, Rich is now one of our strongest campers and admired by all for his intense work ethic and always lovable/helpful demeanor."
